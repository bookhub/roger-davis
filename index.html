  <h1>About the Book</h1>
  <p>In his new book, Roger Davis tells his readers point-blank Wallstreet’s Just Not That Into You. Drawing on an investment career spanning more than two decades, Davis delivers a dynamic and deadly accurate analysis of Wall Street’s “one-size-fits-all” approach—and why even wealthy investors should be wary.</p>
  <p>Davis shares his considerable financial experience with his readers. He raises valid questions about traditional investment techniques such as portfolio diversification, exposing the inherent dangers of relying on any one technique as a primary risk management tool. As a reader, you will be taught critical, innovative strategies like how to stress test your portfolio and “lose your losers.”</p>
  <p>A refreshing change-of-pace from the many books glorifying the buy-and-hold mentality—most of which are authored, promoted, and proselytized by Wall Street—Wallstreet’s Just Not That Into You offers a bold and thought-provoking alternative. Let Roger Davis show you how to keep your money safe and protected so that your wealth will fulfill its true purpose: funding the life you want to live.</p>
